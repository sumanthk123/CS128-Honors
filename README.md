# Explainability-Dataset-and-Analysis-Tool-for-Language-Models

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive dataset that captures the reasoning and decision-making process of large language models (LLMs) in question-answering (QA) tasks, along with a tool to analyze and visualize the explanations.

## Steps

### Dataset Creation
- **Task Selection**: Focus on a diverse set of QA tasks, including fact-based, opinion-based, and reasoning questions.
- **Data Generation**: Use an LLM to generate answers and corresponding explanations detailing the model’s reasoning process for each question.
- **Annotation**: Manually review and annotate the explanations for accuracy, coherence, and alignment with the model’s answers. Include metadata such as question type, difficulty, and the model’s confidence score.

### Analysis Tool Development
- **Feature Extraction**: Develop a tool to parse and analyze the explanations, extracting key features like reasoning chains, evidence sources, and logical fallacies.
- **Visualization**: Create a visualization component to represent explanation structures, showing how different parts contribute to the final answer.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implement metrics to assess explanation quality, including clarity, completeness, and reliability.

### Integration and Testing
- **Integration**: Combine the dataset and analysis tool into a single platform where users can query the dataset and view detailed analyses of the model's explanations.
- **Testing and Feedback**: Test the system with end-users, collect feedback, and refine the tool and dataset accordingly.

### Research and Publication
- Conduct a study using the dataset to identify patterns in LLM approaches to different question types and common explanation pitfalls.
- Publish findings and the dataset, offering insights into LLM decision-making processes and contributing to AI explainability research.

## Technologies and Skills Required
- **Machine Learning and NLP**: Knowledge of LLMs, QA systems, and natural language understanding.
- **Data Annotation**: Experience in creating guidelines and annotating data for AI models.
- **Software Development**: Proficiency in programming language Rust, especially in data processing and visualization tool development.
- **Research and Analysis**: Ability to conduct systematic studies and analyze data for meaningful conclusions.

This project aims to advance AI explainability, providing resources for the research community to enhance understanding and improvement of LLM decision-making processes.
